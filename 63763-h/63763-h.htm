3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Sermon was preached in the
common course of the Sunday Services, and without any idea of its
being noticed beyond the circle of its hearers.&nbsp; As,
however, the interest of the subject, far more, certainly, than
anything in its treatment, has called some attention to the
Sermon since its delivery, I have thought it right to comply with
the request of some respected members of the Congregation, and
commit it to the chances of publication.&nbsp; In so doing, I
have made no attempt to supply its many deficiencies, nor have I
even removed from its opening sentences an allusion to other
Sermons of which it formed the continuation.</p>

SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p>Why repair ye not the breaches of the house?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">2 <i>Kings</i> xii. 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> House is the Temple.&nbsp; We
have travelled, therefore, from the north to the south of
Palestine, from the capital of Israel to the capital of
Judah.&nbsp; As soon as the two great prophets, Elijah and
Elisha, are no more, the interest of the story centres no longer
in the kingdom of the ten tribes: it reverts to the stock of
David, and finds its latest gleam of beauty and glory in the
national reformations and personal pieties of Hezekiah and
Josiah.</p>
<p>Elisha is not yet dead: but he has ceased to occupy the sacred
page after the anointing of Jehu, until he appears once more, and
finally, in the striking incidents of his death-bed and his
grave.</p>
<p>Meanwhile that Baal-worship which Jehu has extirpated in the
north, has found refuge in the <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>southern realm, under the fostering
patronage of a daughter of the house of Ahab.&nbsp; Jehoram, son
of Jehoshaphat, had married a second Jezebel, in the person of
her daughter Athaliah.&nbsp; Jehoram reigned eight years, and was
succeeded by his son Ahaziah, who perished, as we read last
Sunday, with his uncle Jehoram, son of Ahab, king of Israel,
under the hand of the avenging Jehu, the scourge of God.</p>
<p>Then Athaliah, seeing that her son was dead, determined to
reign for herself.&nbsp; She was one of those masculine spirits,
one of those heroines of pride and crime, who can brook no puny,
infant sovereigns; she could not live to be ruled by a
grandchild; and so she took the decisive step of <i>destroying
all the seed royal</i>, after which, it is said, <i>Athaliah</i>,
late the queen-mother, <i>did reign over the land</i>.</p>
<p>But it is seldom, on this earth&mdash;which is still
God&rsquo;s, however much, at certain times, the devil may claim
it for his own&mdash;it is seldom, I say, that crime is quite
prosperous, quite thorough: something is forgotten in every
murder, which rises at last into a testimony; and some one, some
little <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>babe
perhaps, is overlooked in every massacre; there is a sister, it
may be, or an aunt&mdash;as it was here&mdash;whose heart yearns
over that little cradle, and who contrives to rescue its
unconscious occupant to be the heir of the throne and the avenger
of the family.</p>
<p>Such was King Joash; rescued by his aunt Jehosheba from her
own mother&rsquo;s fury, and by her hidden, during six years of
earliest childhood, in one of the chambers of the
Temple&mdash;for she was the wife of Jehoiada, the High
Priest.</p>
<p>In his seventh year, there was a conspiracy, a revolution, and
a coronation.&nbsp; The little King was <i>shown</i> to the
people in the temple-court, the crown was put upon him, the
testimony (or book of the law) was given him, he was made and he
was anointed, and all the people <i>clapped their hands</i>,
<i>and said</i>, <i>God save the king</i>.&nbsp; And when the
usurping grandmother, attracted by the tumult, came upon the
scene, with the cry, <i>Treason</i>, <i>treason</i>! the High
Priest <i>had her forth without the ranges</i>; she was allowed
to pass unmolested through the crowd and through the guard, till
she was outside the consecrated ground; and there she was
slain.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>This was
the curious, memorable entrance of the little King Joash upon a
reign of forty years in Jerusalem.&nbsp; You can imagine how that
scene must have printed itself on his memory.&nbsp; It must have
given a strange, a solemn importance to the house of God, and all
its belongings.&nbsp; The recollection of that sudden command,
given by the High Priest, his uncle, preserver, and king-maker,
<i>Have her forth without the ranges</i>, must have written upon
his heart an indelible impression of the sacredness of that spot
which could thus arrest revolution and make the most righteous
doom impious.&nbsp; You will not wonder, therefore, if his young
thoughts were first turned, as a Sovereign, to the wretched, the
dilapidated state of the Temple itself.&nbsp; It appears that, on
the one hand, there were long, careless arrears of temple income:
people had grown indifferent to the payment of their most
unquestionable dues to the Altar and the Priesthood: on the other
hand, there was a positive as well as a negative defalcation; for
on that sacred height of Mount Zion there had arisen, side by
side with God&rsquo;s Temple, a rival shrine of Baal; and the
idolatress Athaliah, with her creatures, seems to <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>have taken from
the one to build the other: in short, the very foundation and
wall-stones of the Holy House had been gradually pillaged and
carted away, and the House itself stood a monument at once of
modern shame and ancestral glory, needing the builder&rsquo;s
hand to restore it to decency and even to safety.</p>
<p>As for the vessels of the House&mdash;all those costly
priceless treasures with which the wealth and piety of king
Solomon had filled it&mdash;they had gone, bit by bit, to buy off
the annoyances of powerful neighbours: King Rehoboam, at the very
outset of the schism, had given Shishak Solomon&rsquo;s shields
of gold, and replaced them with pitiful shameful shields of
brass: it was too late, or too soon, to think of
ornament&mdash;the present question was one entirely of use and
substantial repair.</p>
<p>It seems that even the efforts and injunctions of the young
King were for many years ineffectual.&nbsp; In the twenty-third
year of his reign the old breaches were still unrepaired.&nbsp;
It is astonishing&mdash;men would not believe till they had tried
it&mdash;how long it takes to re-awaken one slumbering
conscience, or indeed to make one desired work of reparation, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>be it never
so small&mdash;we see it ourselves at this moment in a
side-chapel of this Church&mdash;a fact accomplished.&nbsp; And
so King Joash, stung to the soul by the disappointment of his own
good intentions, summons before him Jehoiada the Priest, his own
uncle and benefactor, and expostulates with him and his
brother-priests in the words of the text, <i>Why repair ye not
the breaches of the House</i>?</p>
<p>And the result of it is, that, instead of leaving the money
received for this purpose in the unaccountable hands of the
Priests, they have a chest made, with a hole bored in the lid of
it, and set beside the altar; and the Priests are to put all the
money which they receive into this chest; and then they have a
civil auditor, the King&rsquo;s scribe, a sort of Secretary of
State, to act with the High Priest in counting and applying the
sums thus accumulated, and so it passes direct into the hands of
the carpenters and builders, and the work is done.</p>
<p>My brethren, you will all perceive why I chose this text this
evening, when we are making our first collection, under altered
circumstances, for the more substantial part of our annual
expenditure <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>upon this Church.&nbsp; It is true, this House of Prayer
is not in all respects like Solomon&rsquo;s Temple: I mean that,
in Christian times, it is not the fabric, it is the Congregation,
which is the Temple or House of God.&nbsp; Nevertheless, without
a fabric a congregation is a rope of sand: there must be a place
if there is to be a worship: and therefore the distinction,
though true, may be overstrained; and I am not afraid to apply to
this Church, the building I mean, the expostulation of King Joash
with Jehoiada and the Priests, <i>Why repair ye not the breaches
of the House</i>?</p>
<p>I have not, indeed, one moment&rsquo;s anxiety as to your
response.&nbsp; You love <i>the place</i>, this place at least,
<i>where God&rsquo;s honour dwelleth</i>.&nbsp; I believe that
your periodical offerings on this monthly occasion will be
almost, or perhaps quite, equal to those which you make for any
work of piety or charity: and I may remind you that there is an
especial reason why your offerings should be large at the outset,
inasmuch as already four months are gone by of the current year,
and we have to supply in eight months the resources (as they
hereafter will be) of twelve.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>But on
this point I feel an entire security.&nbsp; You will never allow
those who undertake the office of your Churchwardens to incur any
responsibility but such as you cheerfully guarantee to
them.&nbsp; I will rather take the opportunity of saying one word
upon the more general question.</p>
<p>We have never in this place&mdash;certainly not for many years
past&mdash;laid a compulsory church-rate.&nbsp; We have always
allowed those who would to refuse payment.&nbsp; Even when the
law was clearly with us, we have never taken advantage of
it.&nbsp; So far, we might, if we would, have regarded the new
Act as confirming and stereotyping our own local custom.</p>
<p>But there were these two differences.&nbsp; We could no longer
carry with us the influence, the persuasion, of an unenforced
compulsion.&nbsp; We could no longer say, as heretofore, He
<i>that may command</i>, <i>entreats</i>.&nbsp; Henceforth it was
lawful to refuse.</p>
<p>Again, we could no longer extend our payments over the whole
Town; and, with whatever abatements from caprice or principle,
hope to enlist, in the work of reparation or maintenance, the
sympathies of an entire population.</p>
<p>It became necessary, therefore, that we should <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>look to the
Congregation alone; and, in one form or in another, ask those to
support, who really love and use, this House of God.</p>
<p>Hence our appeal to you this evening.&nbsp; And if on future
occasions the appeal is commonly made to you in silence, without
special enforcement from this place, yet let me hope that you
will all register it in your minds as a just claim, and not
suffer these periodical gatherings to lose their interest or to
fail in their amount.</p>
<p><i>Why repair ye not the breaches of the House</i>?&nbsp; The
subject expands itself before us, and we read the remonstrance as
applying no longer to the fabric, but rather to these three
larger and more sacred topics, the Congregation, the Church, the
soul.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That anxiety which we do not feel about the fabric,
for we are sure that you will attend to it, we cannot stifle as
regards the Congregation.</p>
<p>For indeed it is this which makes the House.&nbsp; The
building is only valuable, only significant, for the sake of the
inmates.&nbsp; When it is asked of us, <i>Why repair ye not the
bleaches of the House</i>? we may look up indeed at our broken
pinnacles, <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>our not watertight roof, our falling flowers, our
patchwork pomegranates, and think that these too require
attention or deserve reproach; but, after all, these are not the
real things; these altogether make not the House; the House, the
Temple, now, in these days of spirit and Gospel, is the
community, the congregation, the living body within.&nbsp; How is
it with this?&nbsp; Are there no breaches here, visible not to an
eye of flesh, but to One who seeth in secret?</p>
<p>For example, my brethren, is there not too great a
disproportion here between the real and the nominal
worshippers?&nbsp; Is it not lamentable, is it not even
discreditable, that so many should be present at one Service once
on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, and so few at any other Service either
on this Holy Day or on any other? that so many should come
together here this evening to listen to music or preaching, so
few to pray and to praise, so few to break the Holy Bread, or to
drink the Sacred Wine?&nbsp; Is not this one of the <i>breaches
of the House</i>, the spiritual house, which wants
<i>repairing</i> amongst us?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But this carries me on to a somewhat wider <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>field, which
I have called not the Congregation, but the Church.&nbsp; And
here, as is natural indeed in these eventful, these quickly
moving times, my thoughts are upon our own Church, that communion
which is the congregation of congregations; that communion which
we have heretofore known as the Church of England by law
established.</p>
<p>So rapid has been the course of events in late years&mdash;I
might single out the last ten, or the last five, or (quite by
exception) the last year of all&mdash;that Church-people must
prepare themselves, I feel sure, for a speedy, a scarcely
gradual, demolition of all that has been distinctive, all that
has been exceptionally advantageous, in their position.&nbsp; An
eminent man and excellent Bishop, who was laid in his grave last
Friday, was wont to say, <i>If I live ten years</i>, <i>I shall
be the last Bishop of Peterborough</i>.&nbsp; It is more than
probable that some of my younger hearers this evening may live
not only to see what we call the Church of England thrown
altogether upon voluntary offerings for its maintenance&mdash;in
which case some of them may remember in old age the first
collection made in the Parish Church of Doncaster for the repairs
of its fabric and <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>the expences of its services&mdash;but also to find it
at least an open, perhaps a very doubtful, question, to whom
shall belong the Churches themselves and the
glebe-houses&mdash;whether indeed there shall be left to the old
Church of England, as we still fondly call it, any vestige of
that legal standing which has made her hitherto the calm shelter
of her children, the admiring wonder of foreigners, and the mark
of obloquy or envy (as the case might be) to thousands of her
domestic enemies.</p>
<p>I am far from regarding this prospect&mdash;be it far off or
near&mdash;with unmixed alarm or dismay.&nbsp; I never believed
that the Establishment, as such, was Christ&rsquo;s Church in
England, or that the withdrawal of the favour of the State would
be the putting out in our communion of the Divine
Shechinah.&nbsp; It is not so much for the Church that I fear:
for I firmly believe Christ&rsquo;s words, <i>Lo</i>, <i>I am
with you alway</i>, and doubt not that the old, the everlasting
benediction is able to repeat itself in many new, many diverse
forms.&nbsp; I do fear something for the State, when it ceases to
have a religion.&nbsp; I do fear something for the average tone
of religion in our cottages and in our palaces, when there is no
longer <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>one
form of worship which has upon it the stamp of pedigree and of
custom; when it is an evenly balanced question with every man and
with every family, <i>Whither shall I go this day for God&rsquo;s
worship</i>? <i>whither</i>, <i>or whether any whither</i>?&nbsp;
I do fear that there will be more and more in many houses of a
cold indifferent scepticism, a Christless education and a Godless
life.&nbsp; I do fear that more and more may reach old age
ignorant of a Saviour, and go to their graves without any sure
and certain hope of a resurrection to eternal life.</p>
<p>For the Church itself I fear not.&nbsp; In so far as the
Church of England (so called) has had Christ in her and God with
her, she is indestructible and immortal.&nbsp; In so far as she
has trusted in outward advantage, and suffered herself, in her
priests or in her people, to become sluggish, lukewarm,
contemptuous, or persecuting&mdash;in so far let a change into
adversity&mdash;God grant it&mdash;reform her.&nbsp; The great
question for all of us, in our several stations, more especially
in the days which are now coming, or almost come, upon our
Church, must be this one of the text, <i>Why repair ye not the
breaches of the House</i>?</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Let the
Priests of the Temple ask it&mdash;ask it of themselves&mdash;Are
they trusting at all in the advantages of an Establishment, and
negligent, in the same degree, of that personal industry, of that
individual self-sacrifice, which alone can justify their
endowment, maintain their honour, or do their work?&nbsp; If the
Established Church of England, as such, be swept away, then,
along with it, will go all idle, inconsistent, scandalous
Ministers: those who are to serve at God&rsquo;s Altar afterwards
must be only such as are respected by their people: let it not
have to be said that England would gain as much as she loses by
ceasing to have an endowed, an established Ministry, inasmuch as,
quite as often as not, the Parish Minister was an indolent, an
unworthy, or an inefficient man!&nbsp; This is the way in which
the Priests must set themselves to repair the
Temple-breaches.</p>
<p>Then for the People.&nbsp; To what end does a Church exist
amongst us?&nbsp; To what purpose this costly, this almost
magnificent apparatus of vestment and ritual, of Cathedral Church
and elaborate minstrelsy?&nbsp; Does it mean anything, or
nothing?&nbsp; If it represents to the country, in symbol and
form, the wants of man&rsquo;s <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>soul, and the absolute necessity of a
Divine communion, then prove it by the using!&nbsp; Do not talk
of the duty of the State, of the rights of the Church, of
Apostolical Succession and an authorized Ministry&mdash;and never
use any!&nbsp; When the Church of England ceases, with our will
or without it, to be an established, privileged, or favoured
Church at all; then, how many of you will be found to come
forward in its maintenance?&nbsp; How many of you will worship
here, when there is no longer any traditional or conventional
propriety in doing so?&nbsp; How many will accept their position,
in reference to man, as only one out of fifty or a hundred
denominations&mdash;treat with all respect and charity others who
follow not with them&mdash;and yet, for themselves, become but
the more earnest and devout Churchmen, in proportion as State aid
and legal endowment become things of the past&mdash;things, it
may be, of remote and almost forgotten history?</p>
<p>And, meanwhile, let me ask this of the Churchmen here
assembled this evening, Are we half as liberal&mdash;I ask it
advisedly&mdash;in giving for the maintenance of our Church, as
are many bodies of Nonconformists in their offerings for
theirs?&nbsp; You <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>know that we are not.&nbsp; Let us look about us in this
matter.&nbsp; Let us rise to the emergency.&nbsp; Show that you
value your Church, by giving bountifully in her behalf.&nbsp; If
the Church is what you profess it to be, surely it is worth
something, something even of self-sacrifice, to maintain it in
its efficiency.&nbsp; You know that there are many amongst us to
whom the Church costs nothing.&nbsp; On one pretext and another,
they evade all her burdens.&nbsp; They grudge the very rents of
their sittings; and if those rents were exchanged to-morrow (as I
would they were) for Offertories, still they would give
nothing.&nbsp; My brethren, these things ought not so to
be.&nbsp; By this grudging, this ungenerous spirit, we are
drawing down upon ourselves, as a judgment, the sentence of
disestablishment and disendowment.&nbsp; Be it not so amongst
us!&nbsp; Count no money better spent than that which is given
for the repairing of the breaches of this House; meaning now by
the House, not only or chiefly the fabric, but rather the purpose
for which the fabric stands&mdash;the edification and salvation
of human souls.&nbsp; Above all, see that you rightly, earnestly,
industriously use the means of grace herein afforded you.&nbsp;
What would not they <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>give, who are gone from us this last week by disease or
accident, unrepentant, unredeemed, for one such feast of love as
was accepted this morning by but six and twenty souls&mdash;for
one such opportunity as we have enjoyed this evening of drawing
nigh to the Throne of Grace through our one Divine Lord?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Thus, then, we pass naturally, in conclusion, to that
House, or Temple of God, which is of all the most intimate, the
most sacred, the most inaccessible; yet in which, if anywhere,
the true fire burns of an acceptable sacrifice&mdash;the real
altar is built of lively, living, devoted stones.&nbsp; That
House is the soul; and it, too, has its <i>breaches</i>.&nbsp;
Yes, we know it.&nbsp; That Temple&mdash;which ought to <i>lie
four-square</i>, which ought to have everything in its place,
which ought to be gleaming with the fire of the Holy Ghost, and
adorned with the precious stones of a meek and quiet and pure and
Godward spirit&mdash;that Temple, of which the light ought to be
shining through into the life, and making every act and word and
thought gracious and beneficent and God-recalling&mdash;that
Temple is all jagged and disordered and spotted and
sin-stained&mdash;that Temple lets its altar-fire go out every
half-hour, and suffers <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span><i>a darkness that may be felt</i> to
settle down upon its chambers&mdash;making unbelievers at last
say, <i>If that be faith</i>, <i>give me reason</i>; <i>if that
be piety</i>, <i>give me conscience</i>; <i>if that indeed be
religion</i>, <i>let me know only the heathen&rsquo;s
revelation</i>&mdash;<i>of good sense</i>, <i>good nature</i>,
<i>and an elevated self-love</i>!</p>
<p><i>Why repair ye not the breaches of the House</i>?</p>
<p>Do we answer, <i>I cannot</i>?&nbsp; It is a reproach, it is a
calumny, upon the Gospel of Divine grace.&nbsp; That is the very
revelation of the Gospel&mdash;<i>God giveth more grace</i>:
more, as we need more; more, as we ask more; more, as we look and
wait and make room for more.&nbsp; I <i>cannot</i>?&nbsp; No; but
God can.&nbsp; <i>Ask</i>, <i>and ye shall have</i>.</p>
<p>Or do we answer, <i>I need not</i>?&nbsp; <i>I am well enough
as I am</i>&mdash;<i>God is very merciful</i>&mdash;<i>He knows
our frame</i>, <i>and whatever deficiencies He sees in me</i>,
<i>Christ will make them up</i>?&nbsp; Alas! it is too often the
evangelical reply&mdash;if not with the lips, then in the
heart!&nbsp; Christ died to make sin less sinful, to make sin
less dangerous, by substituting a figment of justification for a
reality of holiness, watchfulness, and self-control!&nbsp; Thus
even the Blessed Lord Himself is made <i>a minister of sin</i>,
and man turns the very <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>table of his blessing into a new
occasion of falling!</p>
<p>Or do we answer, finally, <i>I will not</i>?&nbsp; <i>I love
the breaches of my soul&rsquo;s house</i>; <i>I do not wish that
the gusts of passion should be fenced out</i>; <i>I do not wish
that there should be no crack or cranny through which I may peep
out on the world&rsquo;s vanities</i>, <i>nor any secret
neglected postern through which some delicious delirious lust may
creep in to intoxicate me</i>?&nbsp; Oh! worst of all, most
hopeless, this last answer&mdash;the answer of many consciences,
will they but speak, in this great Congregation; the answer which
not only virtually denies, but wilfully refuses, the Gospel;
which makes the Cross an offence, and Christ to have died in
vain!</p>
<p>May it please God, by some one of His thousand, His myriad
agencies, to make us feel! to bring us to our knees in hearty
repentance before Him; and then, even as it is written,
<i>humbling ourselves</i> first <i>under His mighty hand</i>, at
last to <i>exalt us in due time</i>!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
